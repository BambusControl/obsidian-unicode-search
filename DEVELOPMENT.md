# Unicode Search: Development Diary

These are my notes on the development of the plugin.

## 19. December 2024

This small plugin became a bit too elaborately written.
I added the "_favorite characters_," and I'm almost done with it.
It works alright, but adding new settings is tedious, so I'm thinking of adding Svelte as the next step (to make the UI modifications easier.)

Also, I want to simplify the code after, because I believe the codebase exploded for no good reason.
